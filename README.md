# CS 230 Software Design Document – The Gaming Room

## Client Summary
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their Android game *Draw It or Lose It* to multiple platforms. The software requirements included supporting multi-user gameplay, scaling across different operating systems, and maintaining strong performance, memory, and storage management.

## Strengths
I did particularly well in evaluating the pros and cons of each operating platform and clearly documenting how the client’s needs map to technical solutions. The table and recommendations provide a concise summary that could be useful to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Helpful Process
Working through the design document helped me think about the software architecture before coding. Identifying memory and storage strategies, distributed systems considerations, and security needs gave me a better roadmap for how code should be structured later.

## Possible Revisions
If I could revise one part, I would expand the security section with more detail on specific threats and mitigations. This would improve the completeness of the recommendations and show a stronger focus on protecting user data.

## User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on cross-platform compatibility, scalability, and a smooth gameplay experience. Considering user needs is essential because software succeeds only if it solves real problems and provides a positive experience.

## Design Approach
My approach was to evaluate each platform carefully, consider trade-offs, and recommend a solution that balances cost, scalability, and security. In the future, I would continue to use structured design documents and include diagrams to visualize architecture, since this helps communicate ideas more effectively.
